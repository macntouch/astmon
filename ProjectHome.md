Astmon is a group of people geared towards plotting essential data about your Asterisk open-source PBX Platform.
It currently consists of a very flexible PHP class for manager controllability and statistics, and also a version2 to the res\_snmp which will feature an SNMP OID for just about anything you can think of (and easy to add!)

The plugin is written for cacti, but of course, you can use any monitoring tool that can use a php script for a data source (almost all of them) or plot SNMP OIDs (which are all well documented, making OID searching a breeze.)

We look forward to bringing you all this and getting contributors on board.
